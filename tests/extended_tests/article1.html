<p>
This is a simple HTML page. We need it to test various things like <b>bold text</b> and <em>italic stuff</em>, but also
<a href="http://www.liip.ch">Links</a> and of course, don't forget, <img src="http://placekitten.com/200/300" alt="Kitteehs!">
</p>

<p>
It is split into various paragraphs, and also has <br />custom new lines
